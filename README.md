# DrawLS

GOAL: to create different types of level schemes based on input .txt files.

## Python Library Required
- `os` (part of Python's standard library, no need to install)
- `datetime` (part of Python's standard library, no need to install)

## Grace File Generator (build/agr_generator)

### Only States, No $\gamma$-ray (build/agr_generator/states_only)
Generate multiple empty.agr files for different formats:
1. generator1.py: No frame, no axis, only states with related information, and isotope name (currently working on only one isotope case)
